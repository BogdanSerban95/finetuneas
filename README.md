# finetuneas

**finetuneas** is a simple HTML interface for finetuning the syncmap output from [aeneas](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas)


## Usage
1- Choose the audio and JSON files.  
2- Click on the timestamps to check the beginning time of each fragment and use the "+" and "-" buttons to correct the beginning times if necessary.  
**Note**: Before you begin to do corrections, it's wise to check several random timestampts to make sure your data is mostly correct. If it's not, you may need to repeat the alignment with aeneas using different settings.  
3- Save the corrected sync map either in JSON or TSV (tab separated) formats.
